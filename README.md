# About
Back in January 2024, I built the Clash of Code 2024 website and lead my team to first place in the competition. This is where the judges added their scores and it was displayed dynamically in the Clash of Code 2024 website. 

Clash of Code 2024 is the biggest winter coding competition on Khan Academy:

I (@LeaferStudios) and Liam K. (under the contributors tab) are hosting Clash of Code 2025.
